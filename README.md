# JIT Assembly Viewer for Rider

**Experimental plugin** that displays JIT-compiled assembly code for C# methods directly in JetBrains Rider.

## Features

- 🔍 **View JIT Assembly**: See the actual machine code generated by the .NET JIT compiler for any C# method
- ⚙️ **Configurable Options**: Toggle tiered compilation, PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization), diffable output, and more
- 🏗️ **Multiple Codegen Modes**: Choose between standard JIT, ReadyToRun (crossgen2), or NativeAOT (ilc)
- 🔄 **Snapshot & Diff**: Create snapshots and compare assembly output after code changes
- 🎨 **Assembly Syntax Highlighting**: Assembly code with proper syntax highlighting

## Requirements

- .NET SDK 6.0 or higher
- Works only with .NET Core/6+ projects (not .NET Framework)
- JetBrains Rider 2025.2+

## Installation

1. Open Rider
2. Go to `Settings` → `Plugins` → `Marketplace`
3. Search for "JIT Assembly Viewer"
4. Click `Install` and restart Rider

## Usage

1. Open any C# file in a .NET 6.0+ project
2. Place the caret on a method, property, constructor, or type declaration you want to analyze
3. Open the tool window: `View` → `Tool Windows` → `ASM Viewer`
4. The plugin will automatically compile and display the JIT assembly for the selected method
5. Use the toolbar to configure JIT options and see how they affect the generated code
6. Create a snapshot to save the current assembly output, then modify your C# code to see the diff
